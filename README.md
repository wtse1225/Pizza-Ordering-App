# Pizza-Ordering-App
Technologies used: Java, JavaFX, Scene Builder, MVC pattern, Data Structure (ArrayList and Map)<br><br>
By leveraging Java, JavaFX, and effective design choices, the Pizza Ordering Application provides a robust and user-friendly desktop solution for managing and storing pizza orders, empowering the pizza shop to streamline their operations and enhance customer satisfaction.<br><br>

• Designed and developed a desktop application using Java and JavaFX to assist a pizza shop in managing and storing orders. This application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, emphasizing separation of concerns and code organization.<br><br>

• Implemented model classes, including Customer and Order, to handle and store relevant information for each entity. These model classes adhere to Java naming conventions and demonstrate object-oriented design principles such as encapsulation and abstraction.<br><br>

• Utilized Scene Builder, a visual layout tool, to design the pizza shop application's user interface. Collaborated with the team during lab sessions to discuss and refine the window design, ensuring ease of use and a seamless user experience.<br><br>

• Employed data structures, such as ArrayList and Map to store client and order details efficiently. The selection of the data structure was based on discussions during lab sessions, considering factors like performance and functionality requirements.<br><br>

• Implemented event handlers for interactive components within the application. The Clear button clears all fields without saving data, providing a clean slate for new inputs. The Place Order button creates appropriate class objects and stores them in the designated data structure. It also displays a summary of the placed order, including customer name, phone number, pizza type, size, quantity, total before tax, and the total amount to be paid (including applicable taxes).<br><br>
